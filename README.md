# Neural Network
A neural network is a computational model inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain function. It is a key component of machine learning and artificial intelligence systems. Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes, also known as neurons or artificial neurons, organized into layers. These layers typically include an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.

Here are some key components and concepts associated with neural networks:

1. Neurons (Nodes): Neurons are the basic processing units in a neural network. Each neuron receives input, performs a computation, and produces an output. The output is typically passed to other neurons in the network.

2. Weights and Biases: Connections between neurons are represented by weights, which determine the strength of the connection. Each connection has an associated weight that is adjusted during the training process. Biases are additional parameters that are added to the weighted sum of inputs to help the model learn more complex patterns.

3. Activation Function: Neurons often apply an activation function to the weighted sum of their inputs to introduce non-linearity to the model. Common activation functions include sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent (tanh), and rectified linear unit (ReLU).

4. Layers: Neural networks are organized into layers, including an input layer where data is fed into the network, one or more hidden layers where computation occurs, and an output layer where the final result is generated.

5. Feedforward and Backpropagation: In the training phase, neural networks use a process called feedforward to make predictions based on input data, and then backpropagation to adjust the weights and biases in order to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual target output.

6. Loss Function: The performance of a neural network is measured using a loss function, which calculates the difference between the predicted output and the actual target output. The goal during training is to minimize this loss.

7. Deep Learning: Neural networks with more than one hidden layer are referred to as deep neural networks. The use of deep neural networks is known as deep learning, and it has proven effective in solving complex tasks such as image and speech recognition.

Neural networks are versatile and can be applied to various tasks, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and playing games. They have become a fundamental technology in the field of artificial intelligence, enabling machines to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for a specific task.
